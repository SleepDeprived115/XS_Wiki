        <H3>Overview</H3>
        When players face enemies in imminent combat during their missions, they engage in "Battle mode", where the player can perform different actions in order to
        deffend themselves or/and go on the offensive.
        <br><br>
        Depending on the type of mission, the player is allowed to fight alongside up to 2 fellow XS students that they may have set as companions.
        <br>
        During battle mode, the player and their allies may be inflicted with different status effects that may come as a result of
        being exposed to a speciffic type of attack, these effects can be increased/lowered or completely negated by some pieces of <a href="\WIP\XS PJ\Info_Pages\Apparel.html">Apparel</a> or <a href="\WIP\XS PJ\Info_Pages\Charms.html">Charms</a>.

        <hr>
    
        <p> In battle mode, the player can make use of their character's power and weapon to deffend themselves,
            and so does any avaliable ally that they may have set as companions. 
            <br><br>
            Each power has their own "skill tree" that depends drastically on the power's nature
            and relies on the character's stats for their unlocking and further boosting. For a general overview of
            the existing powers visit the <a href="\WIP\XS PJ\Info_Pages\Powers.html">powers</a> page, or for a more detailed info on only the playable powers, seek the
            <a href="\WIP\XS PJ\Info_Pages\Power_Skills.html">power skill trees</a> page.
            <br><br>
            Each weapon has it's own damage output types, (Slash, Blunt, Thrust), and 
            see the <a href="\WIP\XS PJ\Info_Pages\Weapons.html">weapons</a> page for more details. 
            <br><br>
            If you're having trouble at defeating some enemies, pay attention to their
            weaknesses to better understand how to beat them, and same goes for when you feel like your squad is taking too much damage, 
            changing <a href="\WIP\XS PJ\Info_Pages\Apparel.html">apparel</a> equipment to something more resistant to the damage type you're facing could mean the difference between victory and defeat.

        <hr>
    
        <p> When the character is exposed long enough to certain conditions or certain attacks (especially if we're talking about elemental attacks),
            they are likely to be aflicted by a status effect. 
            <br><br>
            Status effects are normally caused by <a href="\WIP\XS PJ\Info_Pages\Enemies.html">enemies</a>.
            Down below it is displayed all different status effects that can be buffed/inflicted upon a character, playable or not.
