        <H3>Overview</H3>
        Bonding is to spend time with other characters, getting to know them and learning about their backstory.
        Each time that the player engages in a positive interaction with another character, bonding XP is earned.
        <br>
        When the player acumulates enough Bonding XP with a speciffic character, their friendship level will increase, which means of course that their relationship has improved.
        <br><br>
        In some cases this will open up new options for dialogue, deffensive battle tactics, side quests, 
        or even unlock rewards such as <a href="\WIP\XS PJ\Info_Pages\Charms.html">charms</a>, <a href="\WIP\XS PJ\Info_Pages\Weapons.html">weapons</a> or <a href="\WIP\XS PJ\Info_Pages\Apparel.html">apparel</a> pieces/sets.

        <H4>What's the best way to improve a relationship with another character?</H4>
        
        It's surprisingly simple, for starters, figuring out what their personality is will help you understand how to approach them during dialogue, 
        while figuring out their lifestyle can hint you towards the locations that they frequent.
        <br><br>
        Each character has different hobbies and schedules, making them avaliable at different times in different areas. Check out each 
        character's page If you want to know already where and when are they avaliable. (Beware of spoilers, though)
        <br><br>
        It is also useful to know what kind of items they like so you can offer as gifts, but beware as gifting too many items at once can
        have negative effects, so if you're going to offer them something as a gift, be very mindful about when and what to give them.
        <br><br>
        While their dialogue hints towards their prefferences on this, we do have details on how each character reacts to some items in their indibidual character page.
        <br>
        See the <a href="\WIP\XS PJ\Info_Pages\Teachers&Students.html">Teachers & Studdents</a> page to look at the full (friendly) character list.
