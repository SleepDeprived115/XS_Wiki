        <H3>Overview</H3>
        There are various locations in the school that the player can visit, within and outside the main building.
        <br>
        Some of these are not normally accesible and need to be unlocked first by performing certain actions or
        by completing parts of the min story.

              <H4>Great garden</H4>
              The great school garden is a very large area in the north'east side of the school's main entrance, it's main purpose is of course,
              to offer the students a large, safe and healthy recreational green area. 
              <br><br>
              To enter the garden, face the school's main entrance and follow the 
              concrete path that leads left, you'll see the school's oval (and the soccer field) on your right
              as you walk down this path all the way up to a big gate, 
              go through it to walk into the garden's main path.
              <br><br><br>
              <ul>
                <li>Fountain's crossroad - In the "middle" of the garden. This is actually the first area that one can see upon starting to walk the garden's path is this fountain.<br><br> <center><img border="3" src="\XS_Wiki\Locations\Fountain.png" width="300" height="300"/></center></li>
                <br><br><br>
                <li>Garden's dinning area - At the northern side of the garden. Facing the Fountain as you first walk into the garden's road, take the path on left side and follow it straight up until you see another stone arc gate.<br><br> <center><img border="3" src="\XS_Wiki\Locations\OutdoorTable.png" width="300" height="300"/></center></li>
                <br><br><br>
                <li>Garden's gazebo - At the southern side of the garden. Facing the fountain, take the path on the right side to reach this area. <br><br> <center><img border="3" src="\XS_Wiki\Locations\Gazebo02.jpg" width="300" height="400"/></center></li>
                <br><br><br>
                <li>Garden's heart - At the northeast side of the garden, this area can be easily accessed through the oval-shapped path on the east side of the garden, just from there, easily take the path on the left and that should lead you to this side of the garden. This is where you can easily find <a href="\XS_Wiki\Character_Pages\Ellie.html"target="_blank">Headmaster Ellie</a> every morning and late night. <br><br> <center><img border="3" src="\XS_Wiki\Locations\Northeast.jpg" width="300" height="400"/></center></li>
                <br><br><br>
                <li>Garden's lakeview - At the northwest side of the garden. Following the same path as you can do with the dinning area, except that you'll see how the path branches off to the left, go down this path to reach the lake.<br><br> <center><img border="3" src="\XS_Wiki\Locations\Lakeside.jpg" width="300" height="400"/></center></li>

              <H4>Outdoor swimming pools</H4>
              These swimming pools are the most commonly used for recreation as they are more spacious and have sunbath chairs nearby.

              Also known as "Classroom A", this is where studdents from class A take their daily lessons, Class A students
              normally are those who are still relatively new and require more beginer-level guidance to control their powers,
              classes taken here are mostly about accepting and learning to live in harmony with their power.
              In order to move on from this class, the gifted student must show genuine acceptance and control their power's basic impulses/reflexes.
