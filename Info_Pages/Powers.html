        <H3>Overview</H3>
        Powers are the special abilities developed by the gifted,
        generally around puberty or in rare cases, this power can manifest during traumatic events even at younger ages.

        <br><br>
        While most of the known powers are the result of natural genetic mutation, (therefore being denominated as “gifts”) it is also known that there are multiple variants or straight up synthetical powers developed in both clandestine laboratories and shady organizations who conduct inhumane experiments (obviously illegal) to try weaponizing these abilities. (Like "The fist" does, for example).

        <br><br>
        Within the game, the players have access to most of these powers during character creation, where they can choose one of them as their own, while the rest of desired abilities would require the acquisition of a partner who wields said ability. 

        <br><br>
        Each power can be upgraded by increasing the “Nature” stats that boost that power each time that the corresponding character levels-up. Although there are certain defensive abilities only obtainable through bonding.

        <br><br>
        Try different combinations, you'll be surprised at how many of these powers you can combine to your benefit!
