        <H3>Overview</H3>
        Apparel has various effects and purposes other than just changing the character's appearance as the name suggests,
        some pieces of equipment can to some extent, improve various stats or decrease others, depending on the piece of equipment in question.
        <br><br>
        While it is true that the player starts with a basic selection of clothes depending on the background story selected at the character creation screen,
        most of the other apparel items of the game require their aquisition through mision/side-quest completion or their purchase within the game
        with in-game earned currency.
        <br><br>
        Most pieces of equipment can provide their own indibidual benefit in the form of boosts or to obtain a speciffic reaction on a companion character,
        which by itself can prove useful in <a href="\XS_Wiki\Info_Pages\Bonding.html">Bonding</a> 
        <br><br>
        There are cases in which wearing a full "set" of pieces of apparel of the same type can provide special effects.
