        Master Alan Enfield is more commonly known by his ability to cast and manipulate Fire, Ice, Wind and Lighting, granting him the title of demigod.
        He was first discovered by <td><a href="\WIP\XS PJ\Character_Pages\Alfonse.html"target="_blank">Alfonse Frost</a></td> in his childhood days at the orphanage,
        where they forged a strong friendship despite their differences. <td><a href="\WIP\XS PJ\Character_Pages\Alfonse.html"target="_blank">Alfonse Frost</a></td> helped him to overcome his fears and encouraged him to accept
        himself for who he truly is and embrace his power. 
        <br><br>
        </brZ>When <td><a href="\WIP\XS PJ\Character_Pages\Alfonse.html"target="_blank">Alfonse Frost</a></td> was eventually
        chosen by a rich family to be taken-in, he promised Alan that he would come back for him, promise that he kept,
        saving every cent drom his fortune to go back and get his dear friend out of there.
        <br><br>
        They grew together along with <td><a href="\WIP\XS PJ\Character_Pages\Ellie.html"target="_blank">Ellie</a></td>, and together forged the idea to create a school
        where other gifted could learn to accept and properly use their abilities, without the discrimination of the outside world.
        <br><br>
        Alan is currently the teacher oc C-3 Classroom and lives within the school in his own private quatters but it is known later in the game that he has his
        own manor out in the north, a secret place that functions as a base for the player in the late part of the story when certain conditions are met.
