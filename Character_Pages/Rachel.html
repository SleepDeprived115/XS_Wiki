        <center><H3>Bio</H3></center>
        An orphan since she has use of memory, Rachel Collins grew up in a shelterhouse known as "Mercy" in United Kingdom. A rather gray place where she eventually
        discovered her levitation power (at 12 years old) which of course granted her some level of popularity amongst the other children who admired her as some sort of magical hero.
        <br><br>
        However, a year later, another gifted would manifest their powers at "Mercy", <a href="\WIP\XS PJ\Character_Pages\Yuria.html"target="_blank">Yuria Lang</a>, who soon became very popular with her Teleportation abilities,
        taking atention off Rachel, who felt envy towards her, resulting in cold interactions between two girls who were once friends.
        <br><br>
        At 14, she was sought out and adopted by <a href="\WIP\XS PJ\Character_Pages\Ellie.html"target="_blank">Headmaster Ellie</a> who also adopted <a href="\WIP\XS PJ\Character_Pages\Yuria.html"target="_blank">Yuria Lang</a>,
        to ensure their proper education and guidance for their abilities. Master Ellie was able to notice Rachel's attitude towards Yuria, to which she attempted to address in a personal talk with Rachel,
        but this one denied any of this and try to pretend otherwise. She of course didn't fool the grand master but Ellie opted for letting things solve with time.

    <H2><center>Personality profile</center></H2>
<br><br>
        Rachel Collins gives off a rather elegant vibe to herself, with grace on display almost at every one of her movements, which can be noticed also when she uses her power, 
        levitating and moving around with graceful movements. The way she talks is slightly paused, as if she considered each sentence carefully before talking, with a slightly low-pitch tone,
        using a very educated, formal lanuage.

<ul>
    <li>Seems at first to hate <a href="\WIP\XS PJ\Character_Pages\Yuria.html"target="_blank">Yuria Lang</a>, as interactions between them are cold despite Yuria's fiendlyness, this can change however if the player reaches bonding level 4 or higher with both Yuria and Rachel.</li>
    <li>She is known as the Music club's vice president and plays the responsible leader role more often than <a href="\WIP\XS PJ\Character_Pages\Benjamin.html"target="_blank">Benjamin Porter</a> (the actual club president)</li>
    <li>Rachel can play the guitar and piano, but as stated up in Likes/dislikes, the piano is her favorite instrument to play. She learned to play the guitar first however, as the piano was donated to the school later after she joined.</li>
    <li>If the player does as much as talking rudely to an animal, Rachel will indeed have a very negative response to it, usually decreasing bonding points from their progress with her.</li>
