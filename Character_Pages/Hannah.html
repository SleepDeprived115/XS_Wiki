        Hannah is mostly seem as a lively girl all around, keeps a cheerful mood to herself and those around with her positive attitude.
        <br><br>
        At the begining of the game the player is told that her room is one of the avaliable options to choose from, as she's currently inhabiting R-4 all by herself and the principal feels
        like Hannah is finally ready  to have a roomate.
        <br>
        The reason she had been alone up until then was because of a number of incidents regarding her use of her power in her sleep, causing several objects around to float and then be
        randomly dropped, causing either property damage, to say the least.
